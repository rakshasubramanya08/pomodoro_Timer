# pomodoro_Timer

A Pomodoro Timer is a time management tool that helps you stay focused by working in short, timed intervals with breaks in between.

It works like this:
  * Work for 25 minutes (1 Pomodoro ðŸ•’)
  * Take a 5-minute break â˜•
  * Repeat this cycle 4 times
  * After 4 Pomodoros, take a longer break (15â€“30 minutes) ðŸ§˜

Why it works:
  * It helps fight distractions ðŸ§ 
  * Encourages deep focus
  * Reduces mental fatigue
